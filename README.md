# Assembly 2025

Repository of activities developed in the MC404 course (Basic Computer Organization and Assembly Language) at **Unicamp** during the first semester of 2025.

## üìö Course Overview
MC404 covers the following topics:

- Basic computer organization.  
- Memory and addressing.  
- Representation of information in memory.  
- Introduction to processor architecture.  
- Instruction set: memory access, arithmetic, logical, and shift operations.  
- Assembly language programming, including case studies with relevant processors.  
- Input/Output instructions, interrupts, and peripheral access.  
- Stack, procedures, and functions.  
- Parameter passing: registers, stack, by value and by reference.  
- Assemblers and linkers.  

The activities in this repository explore these concepts through practical programming exercises.
